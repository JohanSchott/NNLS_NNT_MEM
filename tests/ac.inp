#Analytic continuation settings
#ftype. 0:Fermionic Green's function, 1:Self-energy, 2:Susceptibility, 3:Weird Fermion and 4:odd spectral susceptibility. 
#f(z) = b+int 1/(z-w)*rho(w)dw. Asymptote: f(i*w_n) \approx b-a/w_n^2-i*s/w_n, with s=int rho(w)dw
#Fermionic Green's function: rho(w)>=0. b=0, s=1. a can be estimated but it's not used in the fitting. Can have a second argument, if it's .false. , s=1 condition is removed
#Self-energy: rho(w)>=0. b,s and a can be estimated but only b is used in fitting.
#Susceptibility: sgn(w)*rho(w)>=0. b=0. s and a can be estimated but are not used in the fitting.
#Weird Fermion: rho(w)>=0. b=0.s and a can be estimated and all are used in the fitting.
#Odd susceptibility: rho(w) = -rho(-w). rho(w)>=0 for w>=0. b=s=0. a can be estimated but is not used in the fitting. Use real-axis mesh with positive energies.
