#Analytic continuation settings
#ftype. 0 for Fermion, 1 for Self-energy, 2 for Susceptibility, 3 for Weird Fermion and 4 for odd spectral susceptibility. 
#f(z)=b+int 1/(z-w)*rho(w)dw. Asymptote: f(i*w_n) \approx b-a/w_n^2-i*s/w_n, with s=int rho(w)dw
#Fermion: rho(w)>=0. b=0, s=1. a can be estimated but it's not used in the fitting. Can have a second argument, if it's .false. , s=1 condition is removed
#Self-energy: rho(w)>=0. b,s and a can be estimated but only b is used in fitting.
#Susceptibility: sgn(w)*rho(w)>=0. b=0. s and a can be estimated but are not used in fitting.
#Weird Fermion: rho(w)>=0. b=0.s and a can be estimated and all are used in fitting.

#ExtDefaultM. If to use external default model from file. If .false., use constant with s=1. This is only used if solver=3 or solver=4
.false.
#fam. path to external default model (three columns: w Re Im). Used only if ExtDefaultM=.true. & solver==3 or solver==4
path of external default model on the real axis
#mtr. If (0) 1, (no) multiplication with transpose matrix. 2 means explicit SVD. 3 means truncated SVD.
